abstract ={We measured the elastic properties and intrinsic breaking strength of free-standing monolayer graphene membranes by nanoindentation in an atomic force microscope. The force-displacement behavior is interpreted within a framework of nonlinear elastic stress-strain response, and yields second- and third-order elastic stiffnesses of 340 newtons per meter (N m–1) and –690 Nm–1, respectively. The breaking strength is 42 N m–1 and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = –2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of σint = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.},

abstract ={We present scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images of single-layer graphene crystals examined under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The samples, with lateral dimensions on the micrometer scale, were prepared on a silicon dioxide surface by direct exfoliation of crystalline graphite. The single-layer films were identified by using Raman spectroscopy. Topographic images of single-layer samples display the honeycomb structure expected for the full hexagonal symmetry of an isolated graphene monolayer. The absence of observable defects in the STM images is indicative of the high quality of these films. Crystals composed of a few layers of graphene also were examined. They exhibited dramatically different STM topography, displaying the reduced threefold symmetry characteristic of the surface of bulk graphite.},

abstract ={Using friction force microscopy, we compared the nanoscale frictional characteristics of atomically thin sheets of graphene, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), niobium diselenide, and hexagonal boron nitride exfoliated onto a weakly adherent substrate (silicon oxide) to those of their bulk counterparts. Measurements down to single atomic sheets revealed that friction monotonically increased as the number of layers decreased for all four materials. Suspended graphene membranes showed the same trend, but binding the graphene strongly to a mica surface suppressed the trend. Tip-sample adhesion forces were indistinguishable for all thicknesses and substrate arrangements. Both graphene and MoS2 exhibited atomic lattice stick-slip friction, with the thinnest sheets possessing a sliding-length–dependent increase in static friction. These observations, coupled with finite element modeling, suggest that the trend arises from the thinner sheets’ increased susceptibility to out-of-plane elastic deformation. The generality of the results indicates that this may be a universal characteristic of nanoscale friction for atomically thin materials weakly bound to substrates.},

The G band splits into 2 distinct subbands (G+, G−) because of the strain-induced symmetry breaking. Raman scattering from the G+ and G− bands shows a distinctive polarization dependence that reflects the angle between the axis of the stress and the underlying graphene crystal axes. Polarized Raman spectroscopy therefore constitutes a purely optical method for the determination of the crystallographic orientation of graphene.},

  abstract={The dynamics of fluid flow through nanomachines is different from in other systems in that the flow is granular (no continuum assumption) and that the `walls' move. We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of the flow of helium and argon inside carbon (graphite) nanotubes of several sizes. The fluid was started at some initial velocity; fluid particles were allowed to recycle axially through the tube via minimum image boundary conditions. Argon slowed down more quickly than helium. In addition, the behaviour of the fluid strongly depended on the rigidity of the tube; a dynamic tube slowed down the fluid far more quickly than one in which the tube was held frozen. It also depended on the fluid density and tube diameter. It did not, however, depend on the tube length, because fluid flow tended to prevent the development of strong longitudinal modes, whose behaviour is length dependent.}
