\chapter{Conclusion}
This thesis includes a number of new contributions to the field of manipulated grap\-hene.
For long wavelength manipulations in the form of strain, new terms in the pseudo vector potential were found and new pseudo magnetic field devices were proposed.
The method of engineering the strain fields required for pseudo magnetic fields was studied in the context of the sliding friction between graphene and a SiO$_2$ substrate.
This included the discovery of the anomalous, strain dependent, macroscopic sliding friction.
Using the same experimental geometry used to study friction, the potentially divergent thermal conductivity of strained graphene was measured for the first time.
Finally, it was shown that phonon induced, short wavelength manipulations of graphene's lattice can induce an electrical band gap.
These studies which ranged from the mechanical, to the optical, and to the thermal properties of graphene demonstrated how graphene's impressive properties can be extended in new and exciting directions by manipulating its lattice.
